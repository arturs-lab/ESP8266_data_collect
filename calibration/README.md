##Simple way to get sensors in the ballpark of correct values.

Collect two data points at as distant values as feasible. E.g. put your sensors in bathroom after shower and collect data in warm, humid environment, Then put them outside in winter. Register in spreadsheet measurements from sensors and reference thermometer/hygrometer in corresponding spots. Spreadsheet will calculate adjustment values which can be sent to sensors.
